## **Software Design Document: YouTube Channel Summarizer**

**Version:** 1.1
**Date:** September 17, 2025

### **1. Introduction**

This document serves as the master design document for the YouTube Channel Summarizer application. To provide a more focused and efficient reference for developers and AI-based coding tools, the detailed design has been split into the following documents:

*   **[ARCHITECTURE_DESIGN.md](ARCHITECTURE_DESIGN.md)**: Provides a comprehensive overview of the system architecture, component responsibilities, high-level design principles, and error handling strategies. This is the best starting point for understanding the overall structure.

*   **[LOGIC_FLOW.md](LOGIC_FLOW.md)**: Contains a detailed Mermaid diagram illustrating the step-by-step conditional logic and decision-making process the application follows.

*   **[CONCURRENCY_FLOW.md](CONCURRENCY_FLOW.md)**: Contains a detailed Mermaid diagram and explanation of the hybrid `asyncio` and `ThreadPoolExecutor` model used to manage concurrent operations.

By separating the design into these documents, we aim to make the project easier to navigate, understand, and maintain.
