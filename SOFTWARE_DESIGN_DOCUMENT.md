## **Software Design Document: YouTube Channel Summarizer**

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** September 10, 2025

### **1. Introduction**

This document serves as the master design document for the YouTube Channel Summarizer application. To provide a more focused and efficient reference for developers and AI-based coding tools, the detailed design has been split into the following documents:

*   **[ARCHITECTURE_DESIGN.md](ARCHITECTURE_DESIGN.md)**: Provides a comprehensive overview of the system architecture, component responsibilities, high-level design principles, and error handling strategies. This document is the best starting point for understanding the overall structure and flow of the application.

*   **[DATA_FLOW_DIAGRAM.md](DATA_FLOW_DIAGRAM.md)**: Contains a visual diagram illustrating the flow of data through the system, from video discovery to final summary generation.

By separating the design into these documents, we aim to make the project easier to navigate, understand, and maintain.
